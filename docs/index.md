# Welcome to Zagreus Docs!

!!! info
    This website is still under development! Please be patient while all the apps are getting added to the website.

This is the place where I collect all sorts of configurations or compose files for docker. Each entry to this webpage has explanation

## Layout
The layout of the apps running. Most of the apps are structured like this, if not otherwise specified.

    app-1/            # The app in question (portainer, nginx or whatever).
        compose.yaml  # Docker compose file.
        data/         # If the app needs a folder to store configurations or data about app, create one and name it appropriately.

## Site layout
On right you will find different tabs, click on the one you are most interested in and set that app up!
