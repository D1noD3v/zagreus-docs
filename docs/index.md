# Welcome to Zagreus Docs!

This is the place where I collect all sorts of configurations or compose files for docker. Each entry to this webpage has explaination

## Layout
The layout of the apps running. Most of the apps are structured like this, if not otherwise specifed.

    app-1/            # The app in question (portainer, nginx or whatever).
        compose.yaml  # Docker compose file.
        data/         # If the app needs a folder to store configurations or data about app, create one and name it appropriately.

## Site layout
On right you will find different tabs, click on the one you are most intrested in and set that app up!
